# Custom Wedding Website

This project provides a simple starting point for building a customizable wedding website. It uses Node.js with Express and EJS templates so you can easily tweak the layout and pages.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js (already available in this environment).
2. Install dependencies (includes `express-ejs-layouts`):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Structure

- `app.js` – main Express server.
- `views/` – EJS templates for each page.
- `public/` – static assets like CSS and JS.

## Customization

Edit the templates in `views/` to add content such as travel info, registry links, photo galleries, etc. Update `public/style.css` for your own styles.

Feel free to expand this project to include additional features like authentication, guestbook, or email notifications.
